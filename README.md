<h1>Chatbot Using NLP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project implements an AI-powered chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to handle user queries effectively. The chatbot can recommend anime, suggest recipes, and provide responses to other queries based on predefined intents. It uses machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression and the TF-IDF vectorizer to classify user intents and generate relevant responses.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>User Interaction: Simple and intuitive user interface developed with Streamlit.</p>
<p>NLP Model: Trained using labeled data and predicts user intent based on input text.</p>
<p>Response Generation: Retrieves predefined responses for each identified intent.</p>
<p>Conversation History: Logs all interactions, allowing users to track past conversations.</p>
<p>Intent Classification: Classifies user input into categories such as recommendations or advice.</p>
<h2>Technologies Used
</h2>
<p>Python: Programming language for building the logic of the chatbot.
<p>Streamlit: For creating the user interface.</p></p>
<p>Scikit-learn: For NLP tasks and training the intent classification model.</p>
<p>Pandas: Used for data handling and logging conversation history.</p>
